# 435. Non-overlapping Intervals

**Difficulty:** Medium

## Problem Description
Given an array of intervals, return the minimum number of intervals to remove to make the rest non-overlapping.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
```

### Example 2
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
```

### Example 3
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
```

## Constraints
- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`
- `-5 * 10^4 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 10^4`

## Approach
Greedy — sort by start, track `prevEnd`:
1. If current start >= `prevEnd`, no overlap — update `prevEnd`.
2. If overlap, increment removal count and keep the smaller end (greedy: discard the interval ending later to minimise future conflicts).

## Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
